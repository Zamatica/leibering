		<h2>About Leibering Dimension, Inc.</h2>
        <hr class="title" align="left">
            <p>
                    From the roots to the top, a tree continues to grow for years. Much like a tree, the Leiberings
                    continue to branch out. Phil, Shawn, Matt, and Steve followed in their father’s footsteps by
                    planting trees, farming, and logging. For three generations in Indiana, the Leibering family has
                    been devoted to the timber industry. An attitude of stewardship to the environment, and
                    responsibility to the forest land is evident in all aspects of their businesses.
            </p>
			<p>
                    In 2002, they purchased their very own sawmill. Adding to the business in 2008, the brothers
                    bought the dimension plant next door, and Leibering Dimension was established. Their goal
                    since the beginning has been to consistently provide their customers with high quality
                    dimension products.</p>
            
			<p>
                    At Leibering Dimension their focus is to exceed each customers’ individual needs by providing
                    them with superior products and punctuality. They pride themselves on being able to control
                    100% of the milling process. Leibering Dimension purchases green lumber from Leibering
                    Lumber &amp; Logging, or other outside sources, and uses one of the four kilns to dry and process it.
                    Unique in the industry, they are one of the few companies that has the capability of taking a
                    product from harvest to completion.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                    The Leibering Forest of Leibering Family Properties, Leibering &amp; Sons, and Leibering Lumber &amp;
                    Logging are all FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) and SFI (Sustainable Forest Initiative) certified
                    companies. Phil, Shawn, Matt, and Steve have always had the heart and drive to succeed. Their
                    land forest management is a success story for a locally grown, locally used product.
