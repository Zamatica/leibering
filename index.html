		<h2>About Leibering Dimension, Inc.</h2>
        <hr class="title" align="left">
            <p>
                From the roots to the top, a tree continues to grow for years. Much like a tree, the Leiberings continue to branch out. 
                Phil, Shawn, Matt, and Steve followed in their fatherâ€™s footsteps by planting trees, farming, and logging. In 2008, 
                they purchased the Dimension plant located next the the sawmill.
            </p>
			<p>For three generations in Indiana, the Leibering Family has been devoted to the timber industry. 
                An attitude of stewardship and ship and responsibility to our forest is evident in every aspect of our business.</p>
            
			<p>At Leibering Dimension our focus is to exceed each customers individual needs by providing them with superior products and service every time, 
            we are highly supported by our parent company Leibering Lumber.</p>

            <p>Here at Leibering Dimension, we pride ourselves on being able to have 100% control over the entire milling process.  From the time the timber 
            is harvested, cut into rough lumber, and Kiln dried, to create an end result superior. Strict and constant monitoring ensures our 
            quality and gives our customers products to meet needs.</p>
            
            <p>The Leibering Forest of Leibering family property, Leibering & Sons, Inc & Leibering Lumber & Logging 
                are FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) and SFI (Sustainable Forest Initiative) certified companies. 
                The Leibering brothers along with the next generations start with a seeding and end with a variety of products. 
                Paul, Shawn, Matt, and Steve have always had the heart and drive to succeed. Their land and forest 
                management resulting in quality end products is a success story for a locally grown, locally used product.</p>
